1,Amazon Customer,iPhone is  depreciating asset 😡😡,According to me guysFirst of all I haven't purchased iPhoneSecondly according to me if you have this much budget of more than 1lakhs spending on mobile is not worth at allInfact you can invest that money on apple stock or other  stock  so that the money could get doubled in future bcoz buying  iPhone is a depreciating assetHope you understand 🙂
2,raghav,Think carefully before buying,The product is good but think carefully before buying from here. Apple has new warranty policies. In case of defective product you will not get a replacement no matter whatever is mentioned here. I received a defective device and did not get a replacement from amazon.

5,Apratim roy barman,🍎 NEVER DISAPPOINTS..!!,"From iPhone 6S in 2015 to iPhone 13 pro max in 2021 ,, one thing that still remains the same is it’s performance! I own an oneplus device but there is no comparison between these two! Apple made it a beast. From camera to gaming.. everything is top notch. The battery life is superb, best till now. Normal usage can go upto 3 days with full charge. Bought the earpods pro & iwatch to compliment this beast🤭"
